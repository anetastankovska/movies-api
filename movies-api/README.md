MOVIES API

This api is created for the purpose to serve as a backend api service, providing data to a frontend angular aplication. 
It works with an in-memory database on purpose, so that each student can clone the repo and start using the api easily without creating databases etc.

How to set the project
1. Clone the repository
1. Navigate to the root of the folder and run ` npm install ` to install all the packages and dependencies
2. Run the command ` npm run start ` to start the project 

The default port is 4000. Feel free to change the port if not convenient.

# MOVIES API

## Purpose
This api is created for the purpose to serve as a backend api service, providing data to a frontend angular aplication. 
It works with an in-memory database on purpose, so that each student can clone the repo and start using the api easily without creating databases etc.

## How to set the project
1. Clone the repository
1. Navigate to the root of the folder and run ` npm install ` to install all the packages and dependencies
2. Run the command ` npm run start ` to start the project 
Alternatively, you can run ` nodemon index.js ` to run a nodemon server that will restart on each save of the application

The default port is 4000. Feel free to change the port if not convenient.
